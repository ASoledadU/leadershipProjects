### Responsibilities
This team will be responsible for documenting the day to day events and happenings at Base Camp. This team's responsibilities are critical to the success of the program. This team will also be responsible for identifying new opportunities for chronicling events at Base Camp.

### Requirements
1. Documentation of content covered at Base Camp with supporting evidence of student work
2. Construct/maintain an externally visible curriculum resource
3. Creation of a guest book and strategy to document guests and visitors, the purpose of the visit, and collect photos
4. Building a stream of photos and excerpts readily available to share on social media

### Context
Base Camp exists as part of a wide network in and out of the state. This team will help shape the visibility of the program to the outside world. Base Camp is frequently asked about its curriculum resources, and having a clearly documented map of what is covered with student evidence will help the program's success be shared more widely.
