    <h1>Community Team</h1>
    <h2>Who are We?</h2>
    <p>We are a group of potential full-stack web developers. Giving kids the opportunity to get a head start on using
        the most efficient and relevant technologies for the future.</p>
    <p> Our goal as a team is to show compassion integrity
        and also keep good energy flowing with the kids. </p>
    <p>We want to mold the youth into doing something that will only
        benefit them for the better and in our defense we believe coding is a very positive and productive way to keep
        kids moving in the right path.</p>
